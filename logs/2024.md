# NLP project proposal

- Co-op student JD/ proposal, pending approval

> Large-scale social media data such as text and images as captured on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Snapchat, and Instagram have been proposed for numerous public health applications, e.g. screening of depressive disorders, epidemic outbreak surveillance, tracking of adolescent alcohol and drug consumption. This role will assist in the conception and development of a computational software prototype for an elected public health research problem using social media data extracted from various sources.
> 
> The incumbent begins by conducting a literature review with a predefined project scope (e.g. search criteria and timelines). During the review process, the incumbent will help develop a set of guidelines on the responsible use of social media for health research, as well as the strengths and limitations of social media platforms in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics (e.g. those based on network connectivity measures) as measured along multiple problem dimensions (e.g. public health prevention, health promotion interventions, tracking of clinical conditions, discovery of health risk factors, disaster management). 
>
> Next, the incumbent will replicate two published methods that operate on text and image datasets extracted on social media platforms. The impact of synthesized data and misinformation will be assessed using established methods. The incumbent will also experiment with mitigation strategies to address risks of biases. Project management and reproducible research workflows will be enabled through a Git version control system.
